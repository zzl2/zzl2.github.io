As is depicted above, a number of young people are having a gathering of friends, but instead of talking with each other, each of them is addicted to his or her mobile phone. The lower part of the picture, we can see some Chinese characters which read ''the meeting in mobile-phone era.''

Undoubtedly, the author of the picture aims at reminding us of the double edge of the cell phone. It is well known that thanks to the development of human civilization, many formerly unimaginable things come into reality. A case in point is the mobile phones. We must admit that the smart phone indeed dramatically changes our life. However, if used improperly, the mobile phones also can bring unhealthy side-effects, and imperil face to face communication between people. It is not too much to say that being over-addicted to mobile phones will cost our health, wisdom, creativity, friendship and even our ability to live.

Weighing the pros and cons of both sides, perhaps the best policy is to regulate it in such a way as to maximize its advantages.At the same time, we must avoid its harmful part. Furthermore, young people should be advised that spending too much time in using smart phones is bad for them.
