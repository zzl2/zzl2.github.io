As is depicted above, a number of young people are having a gathering of friends, but instead of talking with each other, each of them is addicted to his or her mobile phone. The lower part of the picture, we can see some Chinese characters which read ''the meeting in mobile-phone era.''

Undoubtedly, the author of the picture aims at reminding us of the double edge of the cell phone. It is well known that thanks to the development of human civilization, many formerly unimaginable things come into reality. A case in point is the mobile phones. We must admit that the smart phone indeed dramatically changes our life. However, if used improperly, the mobile phones also can bring unhealthy side-effects, and imperil face to face communication between people. It is not too much to say that being over-addicted to mobile phones will cost our health, wisdom, creativity, friendship and even our ability to live.

Weighing the pros and cons of both sides, perhaps the best policy is to regulate it in such a way as to maximize its advantages.At the same time, we must avoid its harmful part. Furthermore, young people should be advised that spending too much time in using smart phones is bad for them.



第二篇

​	As Alexander Pope rightly pointed out,''To err is human''.We,human beings, are not infallible and we might make mistakes in one time or another.

​	Despite the fact that we all make mistakes, attitudes towards them vary from persons to persons. On the one hand,some people are clever enough to draw upon the experience and to avoid the same mistakes.On the other hand, some might just ignore the consequences of the blunder and allow history repeats itself.

​	To become a better person,I assert that we should pay due attention to the mistakes and learn our lessons.As the saying goes,failure is the mother of success.However,I think the statement is only half true-if we do not think about the failure and let it pass,we able be not able to taste success.Conversely,if we ponder on the cause and effect of the failure, we will earn ourself a beacon to guide our way though.It is true that all human beings would make mistakes ,but learning from them can make us wiser.

第三篇

​	A creativity expert said:''if you are not prepared to be wrong,you will never come up with anything original''.This enlightening remake point out clearly the way to be creative.If you want to be creative,you should`t  be frightened of making mistakes.

​	Being creative is not easy,because you have to think out of box and keep on trying.Breaking away from established patterns which we used to be comfortable with require lots of courage. Perhaps there is no example better than the story of Thomas Edison.In order to invent a long-lasting , practical  electric light bulb,he tried thousands of different materials.After tons of failure ,people began to mock at him and didn't

believe that he could succeed.However ,he stuck with it and finally made a great achievement.The light bulbs have great change the world.When asked to comment on his failure,he said :''I am not discouraged,because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.

​	To sum up,being creative is tough and calls for courage to defeat the fear of making mistakes. If you are afraid of being wrong , you will never be creative.
